I was able to set up a postgresql server and set it up to communicate with the app. Using cmd, it would ask the user to input their address and then post it to the server. 
The next step I was trying to figure out was how to then initiate an api search using the zip code as a variable and then return the temperature. Otherwise I was going to try to do a google search and use the Xpath to return the temperature. I was unable to figure out enough information about either of these two options to get it to successfully work.
As for the cache, I was going to look into setting up a seperate table on the server that just kept the zip codes and temperatures for half an hour before dropping them. I would have the app search that table for the zip before running the api/google search and return with fmt.Print("The temperature in that area is ",value,". This information is based on a cached search. Would you like to search again? (Y/N)") and then an if then statement to run the api/google search if they entered Y.
